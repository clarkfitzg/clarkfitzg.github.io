My name is Clark Fitzgerald. This blog contains my notes as I learn how to program with data. I am a beginner, not an expert. I write about [#python](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23python&src=typd), especially data intensive packages like [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). Math, [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd), Vim, and Linux are the other topics you might find here.

You can find me on Twitter as [@clarkfitzg](https://twitter.com/clarkfitzg) or on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/clarkf). See some code at [Github](https://github.com/clarkfitzg), same place this blog is hosted.

Programming rocks.
