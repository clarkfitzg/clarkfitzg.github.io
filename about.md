I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics & Statistics](https://www.csus.edu/college/natural-sciences-mathematics/mathematics-statistics/) at CSU Sacramento, where I teach [classes in statistics](https://catalog.csus.edu/courses-a-z/stat/), computing, and data science.
I graduated from UC Davis in 2019, where I studied with [Professor Duncan Temple Lang](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~duncan/) and spent lots of time in the [Datalab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/).
My research interests include software development, data science, and scaling statistical applications to large data sets.
