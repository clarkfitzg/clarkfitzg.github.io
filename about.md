I'm Clark Fitzgerald, and this is my blog. In Fall 2014 I'll be starting as a statistics phd student at UC Davis. Computational statistics interest me, and I enjoy programming in Python and R.

You can find me on Twitter [@clarkfitzg](https://twitter.com/clarkfitzg), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarkfitzg), or [Github](https://github.com/clarkfitzg).
