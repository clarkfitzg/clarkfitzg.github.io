Today I finally got away from the [Wordpress site](http://datalearner.wordpress.com/). Wordpress works fine for most people, but I didn't like having to go in to a web based GUI to do everything. This site is hosted by [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/) and powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), which allows me to use all my favorite tools when I blog: Vim, Markdown, Git, and Bash. Hopefully by forcing myself to use all of these tools all of the time I will eventually get better with them.

Now that I'm on a new blog I was thinking about what I wanted it to be, and I came up with a few ideas. I'm new to this, and it will all probably change, but this is where I'm at now:

### Stay on Topic
This blog is purely professional. I write about math, statistics, machine learning, Python, R, and computers. If I decide to blog about a different interest then I can make a new blog for that.

### Share Manageable Tidbits
Small posts are valuable too, and they don't have to be perfect. The goal of this blog is to record the little lessons I learn while programming, or the results of simple experiments. 

### Link Like Crazy!
Shoot for at least 5 hyperlinks per blog post. This is what makes the web a web. I owe this point to [Howard Rheingold](http://rheingold.com/) and his book [Net Smart](http://rheingold.com/books/net-smart/) where he writes about the mindful use of digital media. Another inspiration is [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). The cross referencing that goes on in that site is ridiculous. Some sentences contained more linked than unlinked words.

### Give Credit
Use the blog to show appreciation, especially to people working uncompensated on open source projects. This can be done through linking back to their sites.

### Make Blogging a Habit
Get in the habit of posting. Could be once a week, or once a month. Need to be comfortable doing this to develop a voice.

### Parting Thoughts
[Jeff Knupp](http://www.jeffknupp.com/about-me/) wrote a great post called ['How to become internet famous'](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/01/05/how-to-become-internet-famous/?utm_content=buffere9743&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer). In summary: it takes time, and not everything you produce will be good. If you're a blogger you should check it out, even if you (like me) have no plans or ambitions of becoming famous.
