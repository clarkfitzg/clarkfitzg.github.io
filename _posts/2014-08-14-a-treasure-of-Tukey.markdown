It started out as a nice evening watching a movie at my friend's house in Oakland. My friend's parent's, came over to join us. Afterwards we were all chatting when my friend's Dad Al learned that I was going to school for statistics. He mentioned an anecdote about John Tukey.

I did a double take. "You mean *the* John Tukey? One of the greatest minds in computational statistics? Inventor of the box plot, fast Fourier Transform, and the word 'bit'?" Yep. Turns out Al worked under him as a post doc in Princeton. Incredible! 

Al told me a few more stories, and ended with "We were into big data before it was cool."

Later Al contacted me and told me he was getting rid of a few books, and asked if I would like them. Heck yes!

On Saturday I received two large boxes of books containing Volumes 1-7 of Tukey's collected works, early copies of Knuth's [The Art of Computer Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming), Feynman's lectures on Physics, and many more classics.

I've been working my way through Tukey's 'Data Analysis and Regression', and I must say the practical viewpoint is very refreshing.
