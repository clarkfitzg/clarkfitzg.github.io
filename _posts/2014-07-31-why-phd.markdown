This fall I will begin studying for a phd in statistics at UC Davis. It will take 5 years. This post explains the motivation behind my decision. 

Michael Lopez recently wrote a relevant post on [Deciding on a grad program in statistics](http://statsbylopez.com/2014/07/19/part-i-deciding-on-a-graduate-program-in-statistics/). He says that students should have clear reasons for going to grad school. I'm doing it because I enoy it, and because the field offers exciting opportunities for those who are highly skilled.

For the last couple years I've worked in business intelligence at Cisco. All day I work with data. I see tremendous opportunity in this field, opportunity to **understand**. Until the data is analyzed, nothing can come of it. 

Mathematical reasoning can be very subtle, and technical experts are hard to find. Many people receive *just* enough training in statistics to do the analysis they have at hand in their field. But there's nothing like having a strong foundation in the theory.

Going back to school full time for 5 years is a big commitment. People realize that it takes many years of school to become a heart surgeon, or a patent attorney. It's no different for becoming a statistician. Indeed, most professional jobs demand many years of training.

Computing fascinates me deeply. The intersection of statistics and computing is an area that will be so useful going forward. Data grows exponentially. Is our intellectual ability to understand this data growing as well?
