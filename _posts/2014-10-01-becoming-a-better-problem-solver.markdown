Today was the orientation for the PhD program in Statistics at [UC Davis](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/welcome-statistics). Professor [Debashis Paul](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~debashis/) gave a few words of advice that are worth writing down. It went along these lines:

> There are two components of knowledge when solving problems in
> statistics - conceptual and technical. Conceptual means the broad,
> overarching ideas of say a most likely estimator, while technical
> means the details of the mathematical techniques applied, say
> integration by parts. You will run into problems that you can't solve
> right away, but later on you figure them out. Take the time to
> understand why you couldn't solve it right away. What was lacking that
> prevented you from seeing the solution? Then you know what you need to
> work on.
